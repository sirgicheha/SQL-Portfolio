# Dataset Details

This dataset was from the [Layoffs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022/data) by swaptr. It entails the tech layoffs starting from March 11, 2020 (when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic), to present, June 1, 2024.

# Project Overview

I prepared the [raw dataset](layoffs.csv) through standard cleaning processes, and analyzed the resulting data to identify trends and create insights from it. My main goal was to understand the impact of COVID-19 and the distribution of layoffs across the tech industry.
